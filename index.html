        <p><span class="first-character sc">T</span>here was a time when male students were recognized by their school uniforms and closely cropped hair, and female students by their uniforms and short bobbed hair. Before the introduction of high school equalization in Seoul in 1974, students chose and applied to specific high schools, and each school had its own unique uniform.

            In smaller cities and rural areas, it was easy to identify which school a student attended just by looking at their uniform. This sometimes led to preferential treatment, such as students wearing the uniforms of prestigious schools being scolded less harshly for the same mistakes. Even students themselves often walked with more confidence or pride depending on their school uniform. It was an era when one's pride could be deeply tied to their uniform, school cap, and badge.
            
            School uniforms, designated by schools for students to wear, are a type of formal attire. In moral education textbooks, students were advised to wear their uniforms to formal occasions like weddings. Today, only middle and high school students wear uniforms, but in the 1950s and 1960s, even university students wore navy-blue uniforms with badges or repurposed military clothing as their official attire.
            
            At a time when university students were rare, many lamented the disappearance of uniforms in the 1960s. Students at prestigious universities, even after uniforms were abolished, often wore badges on their casual clothes to signify their school affiliation.</p>

        <p class="margin-top-10">School uniforms were originally introduced to reduce disparities between wealthy and less affluent students, fostering a sense of unity and community. For most schools, the uniform was considered a symbol of the institution, and students were reminded to conduct themselves responsibly while wearing it, as their behavior reflected on the school itself.</p>

        <h2>THE HISTORY OF <BR> KOREAN SCHOOL UNIFORMS, <BR> BEGINNING WITH THE SKIRT & JEOGORI</h2>

        <p><span class="first-character ny">T</span>he history of Korean school uniforms began in 1886 when Ewha Haktang introduced a skirt and jacket made of red cotton fabric for female students, and in 1898 when Paichai School adopted dangbok (堂服) for male students. The dangbok was similar to Japanese student uniforms of the time, featuring blue and red lines on the sleeve ends, pant seams, and caps.

            The concept of standardized school uniforms took shape in 1904 with the opening of Hansung Middle School. Students wore black durumagi (traditional Korean overcoats) tied with black sashes, along with hats adorned with the school emblem and the word "Hansung."
            
            In 1939, during the late Japanese colonial period, Japan enforced wartime policies and introduced kokuminfuku (national uniforms) for male students, which were olive-drab outfits designed to combine academic and military training. This practice persisted even after Korea’s liberation in 1945.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">The first Western-style school uniform appeared in 1907 at Sookmyung Girls’ School, where female students wore one-piece dresses. By the 1920s, modern school uniforms emerged, including skirts for female students and Western-style suits for male students. In the 1940s, under Japan's push for militarization, Korean students were required to wear uniforms resembling battle attire. Female students wore work pants known as monpe paired with blouses, while male students donned olive-drab uniforms.

            After Korea’s liberation in 1945 and the Korean War (1950–1953), school uniforms evolved to feature dark colors, typically all-black or dark navy. With the introduction of the Middle School Equalization Policy in 1969, middle school uniforms were standardized to black across each city or province. However, high school uniforms varied slightly in design and color depending on the school.
            
            This style continued until the implementation of the school uniform liberalization policy in 1983, which allowed schools and students more freedom in choosing their attire.</p>

        <h2>IMPORTANCE OF <BR> SCHOOL UNIFORMS FOR STUDENTS</h2>

      <div class="block">
        <p><span class="first-character atw">T</span>he Fifth Republic under President Chun Doo-hwan announced a policy to liberalize hairstyles and school uniforms for middle and high school students as part of its openness initiatives on January 2, 1982. The policy stated, “Hairstyles will be liberalized starting from the new semester, and uniforms will be liberalized for incoming students of the following academic year.” As a result, students' hairstyles were liberalized in 1982, and from March 2, 1983, middle and high school students were no longer required to wear uniforms.

            The school uniform liberalization policy freed students from the uniforms that had been viewed as symbols of uniformity, lack of individuality, and remnants of the Japanese colonial era.
            
            Ironically, the necessity of school uniforms reemerged after the liberalization. To address issues such as difficulties in supervising students outside school, increased delinquent behavior, and the financial burden on families caused by free dress policies, the decision to wear uniforms was left to school principals’ discretion starting in 1986. Following this change, more schools began reinstating uniforms.
            
            By 1989, about 13% of schools had reintroduced uniforms. This number increased to nearly half of all schools by 1991, and by 1993, approximately 83% of schools nationwide had adopted uniforms again, effectively ending the uniform liberalization policy.
            
            However, the new uniforms were no longer subject to strict design regulations, favoring comfortable, stylish designs and brighter colors. The process of adopting uniforms also began to involve the participation of students, teachers, and parents.
            
            Unlike traditional uniforms, which strongly emphasized a sense of belonging and control, modern uniforms also take into account aesthetics and functionality while still promoting school identity.
            
            While some schools, such as the Korean Minjok Leadership Academy, have adopted traditional Korean clothing (hanbok) as their uniforms, the majority of schools have opted for Western-style formal attire. Male students typically wear a jacket and trousers, while female students wear a jacket and skirt ensemble.</p>
        <p class="line-break margin-top-10"></p>
        <p class="margin-top-10">Since the 2000s, the perception of "school uniforms as fashion" has taken root, leading to continuous evolution in both the design and functionality of school uniforms. Modern designs are characterized by "tight" fits that accentuate the body and "colorful" styles, making them more sophisticated compared to traditional uniforms. However, this evolution has also led to a problem: as competition among manufacturers has driven uniforms to become increasingly luxurious, they have shifted into high-priced items, contrary to the original intent of reducing financial burdens on parents.

            Despite expressing a dislike for uniforms, surveys over the years have shown that an overwhelming majority of students still support wearing them. While today’s students’ uniforms have changed significantly compared to the monochromatic styles of the past, school uniforms remain a symbol of the most beautiful and vibrant period in a person’s life.</p>
